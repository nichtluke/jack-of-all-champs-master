# Usage
You'll need npm and [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Once you install them you can check if everything works okay by typing in these commands in your terminal. 
```
npm -v
node -v
```
If you were able to run those two commands without any errors, you can continue. 
```
npm  install -g @neutralinojs/neu
```
To run the program, either the .exe file or the following command line can be run. 
```
cd [File Path]/jack-of-all-champs-master
neu run
```
